            Math was always my passion and favorite subject. Because of that in
            7th grade, I decided to switch from a comprehensive school to a
            Technical lyceum. After finishing it, I`ve chosen Software
            Engineering as my specialization at the university. But after
            finishing the university where I got my Bachelor`s and Specialist
            (Master)`s degrees, I wasn`t sure if I was ready to move out to
            another city. And in my hometown, there were not a lot of jobs
            related to IT at that time. So I`ve tried myself in some other
            occupations, which wasn`t related to IT.

            At the age of 25, we were welcoming our baby son and I left my job
            on a baby-care vacation, from which I can't come out entirely almost
            until now. Because at age of 3 yo he was diagnosed with ASD(autism
            spectrum disorder). In Ukraine, it is not a very known condition, so
            the number of people who could help us was very limited. So I had to
            spend a lot of my time learning how to treat my son to help him grow
            not only to develop but also a happy child. But my previous passion
            never left me alone. And since I was always understanding that IT is
            a very fast-forwarding area, I was trying to keep and upgrade my
            skills in it, by getting courses like

            And when my son went to school, I decided to focus thoroughly on
            realizing myself as a specialist, not only as a mother. I started my

            and at Epam Training Center as Java developer, but couldn`t end it
            since in Ukraine the war was started. All our family had to leave
            our homeland and all our life left there. Currently, we live in
            Finland. I was ready to get any job I could, as we came to Finland.
            We met very kind people who helped us a lot, to have some rest after
            our weekly trip, and gave us a place to live.

            Then I discovered for myself SheCodes and that they allow Ukrainian
            refugees to learn at their coding workshops for free. This was very
            important to me since we don`t have any life savings and here we
            have almost nothing. I've applied and was fully supported by the
            SheCodes Foundation. I understand I don't have much time for
            build-up, so I spend all my free time studying. So I've already
            finished three workshops about Front-end development, and now I am
            almost to my finish line on React Workshop.
